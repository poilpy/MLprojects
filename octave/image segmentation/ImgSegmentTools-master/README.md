# SegTool

It is an image segmentation tool based on Matlab/Octave files. It provides users with GUI    
Users can input an image and draw an rectangle around the area to segment.  
It uses Grab-Cut algorithm (variant of Graph Cut algorithm).

## Instructions

* Run SegTool.m file in Matlab or Octave.
* Make sure you have stored your images in InputImages folder.
* Open the image in the tool. Create Rectangular Box around the image where you want to perform image segmentation.
